Class distribution in general comprises of either skewed or imbalance classes or somewhat balanced classes. Either of these have their own set of challenges and metrics to evaluate classifierâ€™s performance. Example of skewed classes are common in real-world data set e.g. medical diagnosis, fraud detection (credit card, phone calls, insurance), network intrusion detection, pollution detection, fault monitoring, biomedical, bioinformatics and remote sensing (land mine, under water mine) to name a few, suffer from these phenomena. Likewise balanced class could be prevalent in stock market data.
